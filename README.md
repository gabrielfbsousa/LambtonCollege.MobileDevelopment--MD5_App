## Project Detailing
### Details
The goal of this application is to receive a text input from the user and, with this, convert the text into a MD5 Hash code. To do this, MD5 needs to connect to a web service through HTTP Requests in an async way, sending the text message. The server will convert and return the MD5 into a JSON, that should be parsed and the shown to the costumer.
